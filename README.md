# NHLsalaryDistributionPerformacePredictions
The main focus of this project is to try to better understand how salary distributions in a NHL team correlate to how the team will preform.
Some questions we look to answer are:
Should a team have a few high paid players that are high ranking in the league, and lower paid players that may not be as good? 
Or should they have a more equal distriubtion of funds with players that represent that?
What model do playoff teams follow when it comes to salary distrubtion?
What model do Stanley Cup teams follow?
What model do lower end teams follow?
